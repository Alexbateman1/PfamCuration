TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a family of uncharacterised proteins with an
CC   unusual taxonomic distribution. The family is found predominantly in
CC   Gregarina, a genus of parasitic protists in the Apicomplexa. The
CC   family is also found in the fungus Massariosphaeria, the bacterium
CC   Vibrio, and in Bacillus phage PBS1. The proteins are approximately
CC   136-179 amino acids in length. The function of this protein family
CC   remains to be determined.
