TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a family of small uncharacterised proteins
CC   found in bacteriophages, including members from Waukeshavirus and
CC   Takahashivirus, as well as in some bacterial genomes including
CC   Listeria. The proteins are approximately 120-126 amino acids in
CC   length. The function of this protein family remains to be
CC   determined.
