TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 607-1034
CC   residues) found in bacteriophage tail tape measure proteins. Tape
CC   measure proteins determine the length of the phage tail during
CC   assembly. This region is often found adjacent to the PhageMin_Tail
CC   domain (PF10145). The family is found in Thermodesulfobacteriota
CC   (Magnetococcaceae, Magnetococcales, Magnetococcia) and
CC   Pseudomonadota (Betaproteobacteria, Burkholderiales,
CC   Comamonadaceae).
