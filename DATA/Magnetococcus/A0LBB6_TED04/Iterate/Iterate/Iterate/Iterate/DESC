TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 41-118
CC   residues) found in plasmid and phage replication regulatory proteins,
CC   including RepA-like proteins. These proteins are involved in plasmid
CC   and phage replication processes and are often associated with AAA
CC   family ATPase domains. The family is found in Pseudomonadota,
CC   particularly Thermodesulfobacteriota (Magnetococcus, Magnetofaba,
CC   Magnetococcaceae, Magnetococcales, Magnetococcia), Alphaproteobacteria
CC   and Betaproteobacteria.
