CC   This entry represents an N-terminal domain (approximately 18-72
CC   residues) found in integrases from mobile genetic elements in
CC   Actinomycetota. These proteins are site-specific recombinases that
CC   catalyse the integration and excision of mobile genetic elements. The
CC   family is associated with the rve_3 family. It is found in bacteria,
CC   predominantly Actinomycetota Actinomycetes (Kitasatosporales including
CC   Streptomycetaceae and Streptomyces, Pseudonocardiales, Micromonosporales,
CC   Streptosporangiales).
