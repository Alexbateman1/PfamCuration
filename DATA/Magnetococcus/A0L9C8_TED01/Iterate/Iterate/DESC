TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a TOPRIM domain (approximately 21-118 residues)
CC   found in phage and plasmid replicative primases. TOPRIM is a
CC   conserved catalytic domain found in type IA and II topoisomerases and
CC   DnaG-type primases. These proteins are involved in DNA replication and
CC   repair processes in mobile genetic elements. The family is associated
CC   with AAA_25 and Toprim families. It is found in bacteria,
CC   predominantly Alphaproteobacteria.
