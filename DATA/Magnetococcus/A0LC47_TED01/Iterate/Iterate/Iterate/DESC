TP   Family
CC   This entry represents an HNH endonuclease domain (approximately
CC   100-127 residues, positions 2-113). HNH endonucleases are
CC   DNA-binding and DNA-cleaving enzymes characterised by conserved
CC   histidine and asparagine residues. These domains are found in
CC   restriction enzymes and homing endonucleases. The family is found in
CC   bacteria, particularly Pseudomonadota (Alphaproteobacteria,
CC   Gammaproteobacteria) and Bacillota.
