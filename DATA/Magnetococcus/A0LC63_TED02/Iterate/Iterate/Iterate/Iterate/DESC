CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 205-267
CC   residues) found in serine O-acetyltransferase (CysE). These proteins
CC   catalyse the acetylation of serine to form O-acetylserine, a key
CC   intermediate in cysteine biosynthesis. The family is associated with
CC   SATase_N and Hexapep domains. Serine O-acetyltransferase plays a
CC   crucial role in sulfur assimilation and cysteine biosynthesis via the
CC   O-acetylserine pathway. It is found predominantly in Gammaproteobacteria
CC   (Pseudomonadales including Pseudomonadaceae; Oceanospirillales,
CC   Chromatiales, Alteromonadales).
