TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 41-118
CC   residues) found in plasmid and phage replication regulatory proteins,
CC   including RepA-like proteins and replicative primase proteins. These
CC   proteins are involved in plasmid and phage replication processes and
CC   are often associated with AAA family ATPase domains. The family is
CC   found in Pseudomonadota (Thermodesulfobacteriota, Magnetococcus,
CC   Magnetofaba, Magnetococcaceae, Magnetococcales, Magnetococcia,
CC   Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria) and eukaryotes (Metazoa,
CC   Ecdysozoa, Arthropoda).
