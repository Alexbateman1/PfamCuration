CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 706-815
CC   residues) found in DUF1156 (PF06634) domain-containing proteins. These
CC   proteins are characterised by strong associations with DNA helicases and
CC   related proteins, including SNF2-related domains (SNF2-rel_dom, PF00176),
CC   DEAD box helicases (DEAD, PF00270; Helicase_C, PF00271), restriction
CC   endonuclease type III (ResIII, PF04851) and DUF499 (PF04465). The family
CC   is found predominantly in bacteria, particularly Actinomycetes,
CC   Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria.
