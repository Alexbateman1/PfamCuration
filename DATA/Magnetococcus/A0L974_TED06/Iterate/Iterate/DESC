TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 813-958
CC   residues) found in HepA superfamily II DNA/RNA helicase proteins. These
CC   ATP-dependent helicases are characterised by the presence of DEAD box
CC   helicase domains (DEAD, PF00270; Helicase_C, PF00271), SNF2-related
CC   domains (SNF2-rel_dom, PF00176) and restriction endonuclease type III
CC   domains (ResIII, PF04851). HepA helicases are involved in DNA repair
CC   and maintenance of genomic stability. The family is found predominantly
CC   in bacteria, particularly Actinomycetes (Streptomycetaceae) and
CC   Alphaproteobacteria.
