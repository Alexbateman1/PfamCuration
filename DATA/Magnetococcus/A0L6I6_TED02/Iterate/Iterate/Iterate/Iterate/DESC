TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a small region (approximately 15-67 residues)
CC   found in bacterial proteins with haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like
CC   hydrolase activity. The HAD superfamily comprises phosphatases,
CC   phosphomutases and other enzymes involved in metabolic processes.
CC   The family is found in Pseudomonadota (Alphaproteobacteria,
CC   Rhodospirillales, Hyphomicrobiales, Gammaproteobacteria) and
CC   Thermodesulfobacteriota.
