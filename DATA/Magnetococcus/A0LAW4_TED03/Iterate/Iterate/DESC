CC   This entry represents a conserved region (approximately 1-199
CC   residues) found in bacterial and eukaryotic proteins, including some
CC   annotated as phage-related. The family is found in Pseudomonadota
CC   (Alphaproteobacteria, Holosporaceae, Rhodospirillales),
CC   Thermodesulfobacteriota (Magnetococcales), and eukaryotes
CC   (Arthropoda, Arachnida, spiders).
