CC   This entry represents a helicase domain (approximately 523-688
CC   residues) found in SNF2 family proteins associated with type III
CC   restriction-modification systems. These proteins are ATP-dependent DNA
CC   helicases involved in chromatin remodelling and DNA repair. The family
CC   is associated with ResIII, SNF2-rel_dom, DEAD and Helicase_C families.
CC   It is found in bacteria including Pseudomonadota (Alphaproteobacteria),
CC   Bacillota, Actinomycetota (Actinomycetes) and Bacteroidota.
