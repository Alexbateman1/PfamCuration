TP   Repeat
CC   This entry represents a repeat domain (approximately 6-58 residues)
CC   found in bacteriophage and prophage proteins in Bacillota. These
CC   proteins are components of mobile genetic elements and prophages. The
CC   domain typically occurs in multiple copies (4-8 repeats) within a
CC   single protein. The family is associated with prophage integration and
CC   lateral gene transfer. It is found in bacteria, predominantly
CC   Bacillota (Bacilli including Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillales;
CC   Clostridia), and in bacteriophages (Caudoviricetes, Uroviricota).
