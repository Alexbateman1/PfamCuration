CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 583-723
CC   residues) found in peptidase M50 family proteins. These zinc
CC   metalloproteases are involved in peptide cleavage and are characterised
CC   by the presence of PqqD family peptide modification domains (PF05402).
CC   The family is associated with outer membrane efflux proteins (OEP,
CC   PF02321) and ABC transporters. The family is found predominantly in
CC   bacteria, particularly Gammaproteobacteria (Oceanospirillales),
CC   Planctomycetia (Pirellulales), Alphaproteobacteria (Rhodobacterales) and
CC   Betaproteobacteria (Burkholderiales).
