TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 587-713
CC   residues) found in peptidase M50 family proteins. These zinc
CC   metalloproteases are characterised by strong associations with outer
CC   membrane efflux protein (OEP, PF02321) domains and RND efflux pump
CC   components. The family is found predominantly in bacteria,
CC   particularly Alphaproteobacteria (Rhodospirillales), Betaproteobacteria
CC   (Burkholderiales), Gammaproteobacteria and Planctomycetia.
