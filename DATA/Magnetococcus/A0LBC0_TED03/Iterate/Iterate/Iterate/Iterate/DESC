CC   This entry represents a helicase domain (approximately 425-553
CC   residues) found in SNF2 family ATP-dependent helicases in fungi. These
CC   proteins are involved in chromatin remodelling and DNA repair. The
CC   family is associated with ResIII, DEAD, SWI2_SNF2, Helicase_C and
CC   UPF0547 families. It is found in eukaryotes, specifically fungi
CC   including Ascomycota (Pezizomycotina, Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes,
CC   Dothideomycetes).
