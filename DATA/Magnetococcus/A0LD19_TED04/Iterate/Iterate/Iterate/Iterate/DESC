TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 427-497
CC   residues) found in paraquat-inducible protein B (PqiB). These proteins
CC   are membrane proteins that respond to oxidative stress induced by
CC   paraquat, a superoxide radical-generating agent. The proteins are
CC   characterised by the presence of MlaD (PF02470) domains and are
CC   associated with ABC transporter auxiliary proteins (PqiA). The family
CC   is found predominantly in bacteria, particularly Betaproteobacteria
CC   (Burkholderiales including Burkholderiaceae and Paraburkholderia),
CC   Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria.
