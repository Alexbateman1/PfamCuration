TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a conserved region (approximately 1-377
CC   residues) found in bacteriophage scaffolding proteins and
CC   uncharacterised bacterial proteins. Scaffolding proteins are involved
CC   in phage head assembly. The family is found in Pseudomonadota
CC   (Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Hyphomicrobiales,
CC   Burkholderiales, Burkholderiaceae) and bacteriophages (Duplodnaviria,
CC   Heunggongvirae, Uroviricota, Caudoviricetes).
