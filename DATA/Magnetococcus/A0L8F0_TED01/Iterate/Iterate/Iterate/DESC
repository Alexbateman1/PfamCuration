TP   Family
CC   This entry represents an N-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain
CC   (approximately 197 residues, positions 6-202) found in bacterial
CC   signalling proteins. These proteins typically contain additional
CC   domains including lactamase B-like, cNMP-binding, and hemerythrin
CC   domains, suggesting roles in signal transduction and regulation. The
CC   family is found in bacteria, particularly Pseudomonadota
CC   (Alphaproteobacteria), Thermodesulfobacteriota (Desulfobacteria) and
CC   Spirochaetota (Spirochaetia).
