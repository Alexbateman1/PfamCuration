CC   This entry represents a helix-turn-helix domain found in ParB-
CC   methylase fusion proteins, located between the N-terminal ParB-like
CC   nuclease domain (Pfam:PF02195) and the C-terminal N6/N4 adenine
CC   methyltransferase domain (Pfam:PF01555). These bifunctional proteins
CC   are components of restriction-modification systems and are often
CC   associated with prophage regions [1]. The ParB domain of the Bacillus
CC   cereus BCE_0392 protein possesses nonspecific nicking endonuclease
CC   activity. The family is widely distributed in bacteria, including
CC   Alphaproteobacteria and Bacillota. This HTH domain likely contributes
CC   to DNA recognition specificity.
