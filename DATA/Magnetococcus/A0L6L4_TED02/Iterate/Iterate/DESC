TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a region (approximately 150-157 residues,
CC   positions 157-311) found in proteins containing sensory domains such
CC   as CACHE and GAF domains. These proteins are involved in bacterial
CC   signal transduction. The family is found in Pseudomonadota,
CC   particularly Gammaproteobacteria (Chromatiales, Thiotrichales) and
CC   Betaproteobacteria (Nitrosomonadales).
