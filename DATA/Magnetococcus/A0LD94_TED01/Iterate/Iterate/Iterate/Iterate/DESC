CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 262-423
CC   residues) found in copper-containing nitrite reductase and related
CC   respiratory membrane proteins. These proteins are characterised by
CC   associations with cupredoxin (Cupredoxin_1, PF13473) and copper oxidase
CC   domains (Cu-oxidase_2, PF07731; Cu-oxidase_3, PF07732). The family is
CC   associated with heme-copper oxidase components and is involved in
CC   nitrate reduction and respiratory electron transport. The family is
CC   found predominantly in Actinomycetes (Micrococcales, Streptosporangiales,
CC   Propionibacteriales, Mycobacteriales).
