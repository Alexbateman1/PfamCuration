CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 250-374
CC   residues) found in nitrate reductase and related respiratory membrane
CC   proteins. These proteins are characterised by associations with
CC   heme-copper oxidase components and are involved in nitrate reduction
CC   and respiratory electron transport. The family is associated with MFS
CC   transporters (MFS_1, PF07690), iron-sulfur clusters (Fer4_10,
CC   PF13237), nitrate reductase components (Nitrate_red_gam, PF02665) and
CC   molybdopterin-binding domains. The family is found predominantly in
CC   Actinomycetes (Micrococcales, Streptosporangiales, Propionibacteriales).
