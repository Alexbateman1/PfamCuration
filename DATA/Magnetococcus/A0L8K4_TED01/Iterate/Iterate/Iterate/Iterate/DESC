TP   Family
CC   This entry represents an N-terminal sensor region (approximately
CC   57-348 residues) found in bacterial methyl-accepting chemotaxis
CC   proteins (MCPs). This domain precedes HAMP and MCPsignal domains and
CC   is involved in environmental signal detection. The family is found
CC   in Pseudomonadota, particularly Alphaproteobacteria and
CC   Gammaproteobacteria, and Thermodesulfobacteriota.
