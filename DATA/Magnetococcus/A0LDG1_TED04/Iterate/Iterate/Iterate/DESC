CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 720-796
CC   residues) found in CRISPR-associated helicase Cas3 proteins. These
CC   proteins are components of type I CRISPR-Cas systems that provide
CC   adaptive immunity against foreign genetic elements. The family is
CC   associated with HD, ResIII, DEAD, Helicase_C and Cas3-like_C_2
CC   families. It is found in bacteria including Bacillota (Clostridia,
CC   Bacilli), Pseudomonadota (Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,
CC   Alphaproteobacteria) and Actinomycetota.
