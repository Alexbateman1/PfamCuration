TP   Domain
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal domain (approximately 44-86
CC   residues, positions 249-374) found in ATP-dependent ClpP protease
CC   proteolytic subunits. This domain follows the ClpP protease catalytic
CC   domain (Pfam:PF00574) in ClpP and related proteins. ClpP proteases are
CC   serine peptidases that form barrel-shaped proteolytic chambers and
CC   degrade proteins delivered by ClpA, ClpX, or other AAA+ ATPases. The
CC   family is found in Pseudomonadota, particularly Alphaproteobacteria
CC   (Rhodobacterales including Paracoccaceae and Roseobacteraceae) and
CC   Betaproteobacteria (Burkholderiales). Some family members co-occur
CC   with SDH protease domains (Pfam:PF01972).
