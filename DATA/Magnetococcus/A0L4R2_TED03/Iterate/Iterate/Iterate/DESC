CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 241-317
CC   residues) found in the iron-sulfur subunit of succinate dehydrogenase
CC   and fumarate reductase complexes. These proteins are components of the
CC   respiratory chain involved in electron transfer. The family is
CC   associated with Fer2_3, Fer4_8 and related iron-sulfur cluster binding
CC   families. It is found in bacteria, predominantly Cyanobacteriota
CC   (Cyanophyceae, Oscillatoriophycideae, Nostocales), Campylobacterota
CC   (Epsilonproteobacteria) and Bacillota.
