CC   This entry represents a domain (approximately 4-60 residues) found in
CC   phage gpW-like proteins associated with gene transfer agents in
CC   Alphaproteobacteria. These proteins belong to the phage gpW family and
CC   are components of bacteriophage-like particles involved in lateral gene
CC   transfer. The family is associated with Phage_portal_2, GpA_ATPase and
CC   GpA_nuclease families. It is found in bacteria, predominantly
CC   Pseudomonadota Alphaproteobacteria (Rhodobacterales including
CC   Paracoccaceae and Roseobacteraceae, and Hyphomicrobiales).
