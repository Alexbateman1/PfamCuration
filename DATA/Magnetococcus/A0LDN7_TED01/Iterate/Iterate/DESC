TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a prepilin-type domain (approximately 19-270
CC   residues) found in components of type II secretion systems. These
CC   proteins undergo prepilin-type N-terminal cleavage and methylation
CC   (N_methyl, PF07963). The family is associated with type II secretion
CC   system components including T2SSE (PF00437), T2SSF (PF00482), secretin
CC   (PF00263) and MshEN (PF05157). Type II secretion systems are used for
CC   protein secretion across the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria.
CC   The family is found predominantly in Betaproteobacteria
CC   (Burkholderiales, Rhodocyclales, Nitrosomonadales, Thiotrichales),
CC   Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria.
