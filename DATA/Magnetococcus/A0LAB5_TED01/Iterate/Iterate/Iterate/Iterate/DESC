CC   This entry represents a NUDIX hydrolase domain (approximately 24-96
CC   residues) found predominantly in plants. These proteins catalyse the
CC   hydrolysis of nucleoside diphosphate derivatives. The Arabidopsis
CC   AtNUDX9 (AtNUDT9) acts as a GDP-d-mannose pyrophosphohydrolase,
CC   hydrolysing GDP-d-mannose to GMP and mannose 1-phosphate, and is
CC   involved in the regulation of GDP-d-mannose levels affecting ammonium
CC   sensitivity via modulation of protein N-glycosylation. The family is
CC   found predominantly in eukaryotes, particularly Magnoliopsida
CC   (eudicotyledons including rosids and asterids; Liliopsida including
CC   Poaceae), with some bacterial representatives.
