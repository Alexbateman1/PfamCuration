TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 623-714
CC   residues) found in TOPRIM domain-containing phage and plasmid
CC   primases. These proteins are involved in DNA replication of mobile
CC   genetic elements. The family is associated with AAA_25, Toprim_3 and
CC   Prim-Pol families. It has a very limited distribution, found primarily
CC   in Magnetococcaceae (Magnetococcus, Magnetofaba) and some
CC   Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria.
