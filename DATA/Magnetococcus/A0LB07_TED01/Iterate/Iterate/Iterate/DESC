TP   Repeat
CC   This entry represents a repeat domain (approximately 10-64 residues)
CC   found in bacteriophage and prophage proteins in Bacillota. These
CC   proteins are components of mobile genetic elements and prophages. The
CC   domain typically occurs in single or multiple copies within a protein.
CC   The family is associated with prophage integration and lateral gene
CC   transfer. It is found in bacteria, predominantly Bacillota (Bacilli
CC   including Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillales; Clostridia), and in
CC   bacteriophages (Caudoviricetes, Uroviricota), with some Pseudomonadota
CC   representatives.
