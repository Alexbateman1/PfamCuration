TP   Repeat
CC   This entry represents a repeat domain found in bacteriophage and
CC   prophage proteins in Bacillota. These proteins are components of mobile
CC   genetic elements and prophages. The domain typically occurs in multiple
CC   copies (4-8 repeats) within a single protein. The family is associated
CC   with prophage integration and lateral gene transfer. It is found in
CC   bacteria, predominantly Bacillota (Bacilli including Lactobacillaceae
CC   and Lactobacillales; Clostridia), and in bacteriophages
CC   (Caudoviricetes, Uroviricota), with some Pseudomonadota
CC   representatives.
