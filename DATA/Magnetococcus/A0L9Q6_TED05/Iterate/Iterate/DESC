CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 589-714
CC   residues) found in peptidase M50 family proteins. These proteins are
CC   zinc-dependent metalloproteases that function as site-2 proteases
CC   involved in intramembrane proteolysis and regulated intramembrane
CC   proteolysis (RIP). The family is associated with PqqD domains. The
CC   family is found in bacteria, predominantly Planctomycetota
CC   (Planctomycetia, Pirellulales including Pirellulaceae) and
CC   Pseudomonadota (Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria including
CC   Rhodobacterales; Betaproteobacteria including Burkholderiales,
CC   Oceanospirillales).
