CC   This entry represents a middle region (approximately 294-381 residues)
CC   found in type III restriction-modification system endonucleases. These
CC   proteins are components of bacterial restriction-modification defence
CC   systems that cleave foreign DNA. The family is associated with
CC   N6_N4_Mtase, ResIII, Helicase_C and SNF2-rel_dom families. It is
CC   found in bacteria including Pseudomonadota, Bacillota
CC   (Clostridia, Bacilli), Actinomycetota (Actinomycetes) and Bacteroidota.
