TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 488-643
CC   residues) found in proteins containing AAA domains (AAA_27, PF13514;
CC   AAA_23, PF13476). These proteins are characterised by a strong
CC   association with metallophosphatase domains (Metallophos, PF00149),
CC   suggesting involvement in ATP-dependent phosphoesterase activities. The
CC   family is found predominantly in bacteria, particularly Alphaproteobacteria
CC   (Hyphomicrobiales, Rhodobacterales), Betaproteobacteria and Bacillati.
