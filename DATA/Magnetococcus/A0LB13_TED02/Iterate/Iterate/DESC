TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 155-327
CC   residues) found in WYL domain-containing proteins and phage-related
CC   proteins. These proteins are associated with glycylpeptide
CC   N-tetradecanoyltransferase activity and contain additional WYL_N
CC   domains. The family shows an unusual cross-kingdom distribution, found
CC   in bacteria (Pseudomonadota, particularly Alphaproteobacteria including
CC   Magnetococcia, Holosporales) and eukaryotes (Arthropoda, Chelicerata,
CC   Arachnida, Araneae, Nephilidae).
