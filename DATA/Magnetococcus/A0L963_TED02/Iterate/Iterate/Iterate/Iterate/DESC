TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a conserved region (approximately 76-180
CC   residues) found in bacterial proteins, including some annotated as
CC   transcription elongation factors and various uncharacterised
CC   proteins. The family is found in Pseudomonadota, particularly
CC   Alphaproteobacteria (Hyphomicrobiales, Rhodospirillales,
CC   Terasakiellaceae, Methylobacteriaceae, Thalassobaculaceae) and
CC   Gammaproteobacteria.
