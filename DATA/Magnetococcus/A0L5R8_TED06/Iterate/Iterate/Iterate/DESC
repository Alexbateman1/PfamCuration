CC   This entry represents a middle region 3 (approximately 746-878
CC   residues) found in type III restriction-modification system
CC   endonucleases. These proteins are components of bacterial
CC   restriction-modification defence systems that cleave foreign DNA. The
CC   family is associated with N6_N4_Mtase, ResIII, Helicase_C and
CC   SNF2-rel_dom families. It is found in bacteria including
CC   Pseudomonadota (Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,
CC   Alphaproteobacteria), Bacillota (Clostridia, Bacilli), Actinomycetota
CC   (Actinomycetes) and Bacteroidota.
