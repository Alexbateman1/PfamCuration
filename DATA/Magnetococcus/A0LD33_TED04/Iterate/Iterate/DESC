CC   This entry represents a linker region (approximately 45 residues,
CC   positions ~549-593) found in hybrid chemotaxis proteins containing
CC   both CheB methylesterase and CheR methyltransferase domains. These
CC   bifunctional proteins are involved in bacterial chemotaxis signal
CC   transduction. The family is found in diverse bacteria including
CC   Pseudomonadota, Cyanobacteriota, Bacteroidota, and
CC   Planctomycetota.
