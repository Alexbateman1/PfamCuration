TP   Domain
CC   This entry represents an N-terminal domain (approximately 75-80
CC   residues) associated with DUF3489 (Pfam:PF11994). This domain is
CC   found in uncharacterised proteins from Alphaproteobacteria,
CC   particularly within the Rhodobacterales order (Paracoccaceae,
CC   Roseobacteraceae). The domain typically precedes a DUF3489 domain
CC   and is found in proteins that appear to be associated with mobile
CC   genetic elements and prophage regions. STRING analysis suggests
CC   functional links to ParB-methyltransferase systems, RNA polymerases
CC   and phage-related proteins. The family is exclusively bacterial,
CC   distributed predominantly in Alphaproteobacteria. The specific
CC   function of this N-terminal domain remains to be determined.
