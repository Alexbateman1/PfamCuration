CC   This entry represents an N-terminal region (approximately 7-84
CC   residues) found in association with DUF3489 (PF11994) domains. Based on
CC   sequence associations with phage portal proteins, RNA polymerase
CC   subunits, methyltransferases and related mobile genetic element
CC   components, these proteins likely function in bacteriophage-related
CC   processes or gene transfer. The family is found predominantly in
CC   Alphaproteobacteria (Rhodobacterales including Paracoccaceae,
CC   Roseobacteraceae and Paracoccus).
