TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 149-172
CC   residues, positions 145-316) found in bacterial proteins associated
CC   with guanylate and adenylate cyclase domains. These proteins are
CC   involved in cyclic nucleotide signalling. The family is found in
CC   bacteria, particularly Pseudomonadota (Alphaproteobacteria),
CC   Actinomycetota (Actinomycetes, Mycobacteriales) and Bacillota.
