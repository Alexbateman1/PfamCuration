TP   Family
CC   This entry represents an N-terminal region (approximately 104-130
CC   residues, positions 7-136) found in bacterial proteins associated
CC   with guanylate and adenylate cyclase domains. These proteins are
CC   involved in cyclic nucleotide signalling. The family is found in
CC   bacteria, particularly Pseudomonadota (Alphaproteobacteria),
CC   Actinomycetota (Actinomycetes, Mycobacteriales) and Bacillota.
