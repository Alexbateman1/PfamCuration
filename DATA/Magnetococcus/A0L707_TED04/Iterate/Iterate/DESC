TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 41-118
CC   residues) found in plasmid and phage replication regulatory proteins,
CC   including RepA-like proteins and DNA primase proteins with TOPRIM
CC   domains. These proteins are involved in plasmid and phage replication
CC   processes and are often associated with AAA family ATPase domains. The
CC   family is found in Pseudomonadota, particularly Thermodesulfobacteriota
CC   (Magnetococcus, Magnetofaba, Magnetococcaceae, Magnetococcales,
CC   Magnetococcia), Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria.
