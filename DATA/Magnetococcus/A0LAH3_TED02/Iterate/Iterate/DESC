TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a DNA-binding domain (approximately 57-67
CC   residues, positions 65-126) related to the CRP/FNR family of
CC   transcriptional regulators. These domains bind DNA to regulate gene
CC   expression in response to environmental signals. The family is found
CC   in Gammaproteobacteria, particularly Chromatiales (sulphur-oxidising
CC   bacteria), Thiotrichales and Acidithiobacillales.
