CC   This entry represents an N-terminal region (approximately 3-58
CC   residues) found in AAA family ATPases. These proteins are involved in
CC   diverse cellular processes including DNA replication, protein
CC   degradation, membrane fusion and signal transduction. The family is
CC   associated with the AAA family. It is found in bacteria, predominantly
CC   Pseudomonadota (Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria) and
CC   Actinomycetota (Actinomycetes).
