TP   Family
CC   This entry represents the gpW protein family found in
CC   bacteriophages and prophages. GpW proteins are small phage tail
CC   proteins involved in virion assembly. The family is found
CC   predominantly in Alphaproteobacteria, particularly in
CC   Rhodobacterales (Paracoccaceae, Roseobacteraceae). STRING
CC   analysis shows functional association with phage portal proteins
CC   (Pfam:PF05136), GpA ATPase (Pfam:PF05876), and GpA nuclease
CC   (Pfam:PF20454).
