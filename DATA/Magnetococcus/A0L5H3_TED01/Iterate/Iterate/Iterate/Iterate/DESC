CC   This entry represents an N-terminal DNA binding domain (approximately
CC   3-71 residues) found in excisionase proteins from mobile genetic
CC   elements. These proteins are components of integrative conjugative
CC   elements (ICEs) and prophages involved in site-specific recombination
CC   and excision from bacterial chromosomes. The family is associated with
CC   helix-turn-helix DNA binding domains (HTH_17) and is found in
CC   toxin-antitoxin systems. It is found in bacteria, predominantly
CC   Pseudomonadota (Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria including
CC   Burkholderiales; Alphaproteobacteria), Actinomycetota (Actinomycetes)
CC   and Bacteroidota.
