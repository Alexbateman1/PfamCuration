TP   Family
CC   This entry represents an N-terminal region (approximately 7-71
CC   residues) found in bacteriophage and prophage proteins. These proteins
CC   are characterised by the presence of DUF6900 (PF21841) and DUF3489
CC   (PF11994) domains. Based on sequence associations with phage portal
CC   proteins, GpA ATPase, GpA nuclease and RNA polymerase subunits, these
CC   proteins are likely components of bacteriophage particles or
CC   prophages. The family is found predominantly in Alphaproteobacteria
CC   (Rhodobacterales including Paracoccaceae and Roseobacteraceae;
CC   Sphingomonadales).
