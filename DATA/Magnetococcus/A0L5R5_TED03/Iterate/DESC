TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 507-625
CC   residues) found in type III restriction-modification system
CC   methyltransferases. These proteins are site-specific DNA
CC   methyltransferases that modify DNA as part of bacterial defence systems
CC   against foreign DNA. The family is associated with N6_N4_Mtase family.
CC   It is found in bacteria including Pseudomonadota (Gammaproteobacteria,
CC   Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria) and Bacteroidota.
