CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 10-154
CC   residues) found in type III restriction-modification system proteins,
CC   including site-specific DNA-methyltransferases and restriction
CC   endonucleases. These proteins are components of bacterial
CC   restriction-modification defence systems against foreign DNA. The
CC   family shows structural similarity to T3RM_EcoP15I_C and is associated
CC   with ResIII, RE_endonuc, DEAD helicase and SNF2-rel_dom families. It
CC   is found in Pseudomonadota (Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria,
CC   Alphaproteobacteria) and Bacteroidota.
