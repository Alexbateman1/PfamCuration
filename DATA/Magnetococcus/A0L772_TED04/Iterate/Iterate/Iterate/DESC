TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 41-118
CC   residues) found in plasmid and phage replication regulatory proteins,
CC   including RepA-like proteins and DNA primase proteins. These proteins
CC   are involved in plasmid and phage replication processes and are often
CC   associated with AAA family ATPase domains. The family is found in
CC   Pseudomonadota (Thermodesulfobacteriota, Magnetococcus, Magnetofaba,
CC   Magnetococcaceae, Magnetococcales, Magnetococcia, Alphaproteobacteria,
CC   Betaproteobacteria) and eukaryotes (Metazoa, Ecdysozoa, Arthropoda).
