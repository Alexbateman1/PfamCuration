TP   Family
CC   This entry represents a C-terminal region (approximately 377-451
CC   residues) found in bacteriophage proteins, including SPP1 gp7 family
CC   proteins and phage head morphogenesis proteins. These proteins are
CC   associated with Phage_Mu_F domains and are found in Mu-like prophages.
CC   The family is found in Pseudomonadota (Gammaproteobacteria,
CC   Pasteurellales, Pasteurellaceae; Alphaproteobacteria,
CC   Hyphomicrobiales; Betaproteobacteria).
