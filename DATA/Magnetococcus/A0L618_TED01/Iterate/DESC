TP   Family
CC   This entry represents an N-terminal region (approximately 133
CC   residues, positions 15-147) found in YkvP/CgeB family spore
CC   proteins. These proteins contain glycosyltransferase activity and are
CC   involved in bacterial spore formation. The family is found in
CC   bacteria, particularly Thermodesulfobacteriota (Desulfovibrionia,
CC   Magnetococcia) and Pseudomonadota.
