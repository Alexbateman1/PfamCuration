CC   This entry represents an N-terminal region (approximately 2-29
CC   residues) found in IS3/IS911 family transposases. These proteins are
CC   mobile genetic elements involved in DNA transposition. The family is
CC   associated with HTH_Tnp_1, HTH_21, rve and rva_4 families. It is
CC   widely distributed in bacteria including Alphaproteobacteria, Bacillota
CC   (Clostridia, Bacilli) and Bacteroidota.
