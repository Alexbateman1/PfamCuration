TP   Family
CC   This entry represents an N-terminal region (approximately 5-145
CC   residues) found in WYL domain-containing proteins. These proteins
CC   contain additional WYL_C domains and are involved in nucleic acid
CC   binding and immune functions. The family shows an unusual
CC   cross-kingdom distribution, found in bacteria (Pseudomonadota,
CC   particularly Alphaproteobacteria including Magnetococcia,
CC   Holosporales) and eukaryotes (Arthropoda, Chelicerata, Arachnida,
CC   Araneae, Nephilidae).
