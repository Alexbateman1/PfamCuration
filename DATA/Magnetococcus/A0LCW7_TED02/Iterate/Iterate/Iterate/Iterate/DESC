TP   Family
CC   This entry represents an N-terminal region (approximately 135-346
CC   residues) found in association with MMR_HSR1 (PF01926) domains. MMR_HSR1
CC   is a family related to DNA mismatch repair and heat shock response. The
CC   family is found predominantly in bacteria, particularly Gammaproteobacteria
CC   (Chromatiales), Cyanophyceae, Planctomycetia and Alphaproteobacteria.
