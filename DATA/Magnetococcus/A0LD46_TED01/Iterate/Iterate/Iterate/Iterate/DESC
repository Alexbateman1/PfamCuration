RT   The HmrABCX pathway regulates the transition between motile and
RT   sessile lifestyles in Caulobacter crescentus by a mechanism
RT   independent of hfiA transcription.

CC   This entry represents an N-terminal sensor domain (approximately
CC   29-143 residues) found in histidine kinases and related signal
CC   transduction proteins. Histidine kinases are part of two-component
CC   regulatory systems that sense environmental stimuli and phosphorylate
CC   response regulators. The family includes HmrA, an histidine kinase
CC   involved in the switch from motile to sessile lifestyle. The family
CC   shows structural similarity to SMP_2, CHASE8 and GAPES3 domains in
CC   clan CL0165. It is found in Pseudomonadota, particularly
CC   Gammaproteobacteria (Thiotrichales, Chromatiales, Oceanospirillales),
CC   Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria (Burkholderiales).
