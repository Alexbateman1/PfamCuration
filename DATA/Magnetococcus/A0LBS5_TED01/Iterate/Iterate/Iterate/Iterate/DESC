CC   This entry represents an N-terminal domain (approximately 2-36
CC   residues) found in recombinases and resolvases from mobile genetic
CC   elements. Based on sequence associations with resolvases,
CC   recombinases, and zinc-ribbon recombination domains, these proteins
CC   function in site-specific recombination, DNA integration, and excision
CC   of mobile genetic elements. The family is found predominantly in
CC   Alphaproteobacteria (Rhodobacterales including Paracoccaceae and
CC   Roseobacteraceae; Hyphomicrobiales; Acetobacterales including
CC   Roseomonadaceae).
