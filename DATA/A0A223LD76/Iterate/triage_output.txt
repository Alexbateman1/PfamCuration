================================================================================
Protein: VIMSS358238 (E-value: 0.00091, Score: 24.2)
Mentioned as: BC0914
Description: hypothetical protein
Organism: Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579
PMID: 18464912
Source: EuropePMC
Title: Accurate localization of the integration sites of two genomic islands at single-nucleotide resolution in the genome of Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987
Journal: Comparative and functional genomics (2008)
Snippet: the homologous ORF's. (a) Conservation of gene orders around BCEGI-1. Briefly, except ORF's BCE0913 and BC0914, all corresponding ORF's are homologous. (b) Conservation of gene orders around BCEGI-2. All corresponding ORF's are homologous. BC denotes B. cereus ATCC 14579, whereas BCE denotes B. cereus ATCC 10987.
