CC   This entry represents a family of proteins found in jumbo
CC   bacteriophages, including members from Tepukevirus, Phikzvirus,
CC   Serwervirus, and related phages. The proteins are approximately
CC   415-420 amino acids in length. One member, PHIKZ089 from
CC   Pseudomonas phage phiKZ, was identified in a study of the
CC   lipid-based jumbo phage compartment [1]. The function of this
CC   protein family remains to be determined.
