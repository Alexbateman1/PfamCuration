Title: RapD Is a Multimeric Calcium-Binding Protein That Interacts With the <i>Rhizobium leguminosarum</i> Biofilm Exopolysaccharide, Influencing the Polymer Lengths
Journal: Frontiers in microbiology (2022)
Snippet: three novel PrsDE dependent extracellular proteins were detected in Rlv 3841: a calcium-binding RTX Zn-metalloprotease (Q1ML69), the RapB protein (Q1MCD0), and the PlyC glycanase (Q1MEW3). These proteins were previously proposed in silico as putative TISS substrates ( Krehenbrink and Downie, 2008 ; Table 1 and Supplementary
