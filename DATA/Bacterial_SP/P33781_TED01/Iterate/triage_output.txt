Protein: P33781 (E-value: 1.8e-16, Score: 65.6)
Mentioned as: P33781
Description: CS5 fimbrial subunit
Organism: Escherichia coli
PMID: 36839555
Source: EuropePMC
Title: Strong Association between Diarrhea and Concentration of Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> Strain TW10722 in Stools of Experimentally Infected Volunteers
Journal: Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland) (2023)
Snippet: coupled with recombinantly produced and purified CS5 or YghJ. YghJ ( yghJ ; UniProtKB ID: P33781) is a conserved mucin-degrading E. coli metalloprotease [ 7 ], and CS5 ( csfA; UniProtKB ID: P0CK95) is a colonization factor involved in anchoring ETEC to the intestinal epithelial cells

Title: A new human challenge model for testing heat-stable toxin-based vaccine candidates for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhea - dose optimization, clinical outcomes, and CD4+ T cell responses
Journal: PLoS neglected tropical diseases (2019)
Snippet: reference accession numbers for the proteins used in immunological assays in the present study are P33781 (YghJ), P0CK95 (CsfA) and P53508 (CssA). The relevant PCR fragments were ligated into pET-30 (for CsfA and YghJ) and pET-32 (for CssA) expression vectors and transformed into ClearColi BL21(DE3) (Lucigen
