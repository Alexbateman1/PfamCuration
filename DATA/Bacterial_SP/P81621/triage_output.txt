================================================================================
Protein: VIMSS928907 (E-value: 1.2e-08, Score: 39.4)
Mentioned as: stu0723
Description: peroxide resistance protein,non-heme iron-containing ferritin
Organism: Streptococcus thermophilus LMG 18311
PMID: 22022447
Source: EuropePMC
Title: Transcriptome analysis of adaptive heat shock response of Streptococcus thermophilus
Journal: PloS one (2011)
Snippet: of two-component regulatory system. In particular, a Fur regulator (stu0724) and the iron chelator dpr (stu0723) were more than 3 folds and 2 folds down-regulated at 50C, respectively. This observation is in accordance with previous study that temperature change can influence the differential expression of genes
