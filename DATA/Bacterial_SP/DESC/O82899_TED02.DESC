CC   This entry represents the C-terminal domain of the uncharacterised
CC   protein YubG and related proteins found in Enterobacteriaceae. The
CC   domain is approximately 107 residues in length. YubG is encoded on
CC   the pO157 virulence plasmid of Escherichia coli O157:H7 [1] and
CC   homologues are found on plasmids in other Enterobacteriaceae. The
CC   function of this domain remains to be determined.
