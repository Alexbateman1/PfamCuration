TP   Family
CC   This entry represents O-antigen polymerase (Wzy) found in
CC   Escherichia coli K12 and a few related bacteria. Wzy may function as
CC   a polymerase that catalyses the polymerisation of the O-antigen
CC   repeat units on the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, leading
CC   to the formation of the lipid-linked O-antigen molecule. However, E.
CC   coli K12 strains do not normally produce the O-antigen due to
CC   mutations in the rfb gene cluster. K12 strains are phenotypically
CC   rough, their lipopolysaccharide having a complete core structure but
CC   no O-antigen. The protein is localised to the cell inner membrane
CC   with multiple transmembrane helices and is classified as
CC   NCBIfam:TIGR04370 (glyco_rpt_poly).

TP   Domain
CC   This entry represents an uncharacterised domain found in
CC   Prevotella. within Bacteria. The function of this domain remains to be
CC   determined.
