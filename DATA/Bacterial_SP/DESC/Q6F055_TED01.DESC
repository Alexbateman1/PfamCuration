CC   This entry represents the N-terminal domain of an uncharacterised
CC   protein encoded on plasmid pXO2 from Bacillus anthracis. The
CC   full-length protein pXO2-22 (also known as BXB0021 or GBAA_pXO2_0021)
CC   is approximately 249 amino acids. The protein is predicted to be
CC   localised to the cell membrane and contains two transmembrane helices.
CC   Plasmid pXO2 is one of two virulence plasmids found in Bacillus
CC   anthracis. Members are also found in Listeria and related genera. The
CC   function of this N-terminal domain remains to be determined.
