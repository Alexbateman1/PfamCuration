CC   This entry represents protein FptB found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
CC   and related Pseudomonadota. FptB may play a role in the transport of
CC   Fe(3+)-pyochelin. The protein is encoded in the fpt operon which is
CC   involved in iron acquisition via the pyochelin siderophore system.
CC   The function of this protein remains to be determined.
