CC   This entry represents a domain of unknown function found in putative
CC   lipoproteins from Tannerella species. This domain of approximately
CC   100 amino acids is predicted by the TED pipeline based on AlphaFold
CC   structures (residues 37-140). The function of this domain remains to
CC   be determined.
