CC   This entry represents microcin H47 (MccH47), a bactericidal antibiotic
CC   peptide of approximately 60 amino acids found in Escherichia coli and
CC   related Enterobacteriaceae. The mature peptide is secreted, probably
CC   through the MchEF ABC transporter system, and localises to the host
CC   cell membrane where it acts as a single-pass transmembrane protein.
CC   The peptide is active against bacteria phylogenetically related to
CC   the producing strain.
