TP   Family
CC   This entry represents ATP synthase protein I, a membrane protein
CC   found in Mycoplasmoides gallisepticum and related Mycoplasmatota. A
CC   possible function for this protein is to guide the assembly of the
CC   membrane sector of the ATPase enzyme complex. The protein belongs to
CC   the bacterial AtpI family and is classified as NCBIfam:NF033688
CC   (MG406_fam). This protein is localised to the cell membrane with
CC   four predicted transmembrane helices. The function of this protein
CC   remains to be determined.

TP   Domain
CC   This entry represents an uncharacterised domain found in
CC   Mycoplasmoides within Bacteria. The function of this domain remains to be
CC   determined.
