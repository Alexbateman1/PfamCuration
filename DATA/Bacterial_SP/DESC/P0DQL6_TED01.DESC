CC   This entry represents a domain of unknown function found in
CC   Clostridium species. This domain of approximately 60 amino acids is
CC   predicted by the TED pipeline based on the AlphaFold structure of
CC   protein P0DQL6 (residues 4-63). The function of this domain remains
CC   to be determined.
