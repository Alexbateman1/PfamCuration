TP   Domain
CC   This entry represents a domain of approximately 35 amino acids found
CC   in proteins from Enterobacteriaceae, including YddJ from Escherichia
CC   coli. The E. coli protein may be the product of a pseudogene, as it
CC   is missing approximately 320 N-terminal residues compared to
CC   orthologues. The function of this domain remains to be determined.
