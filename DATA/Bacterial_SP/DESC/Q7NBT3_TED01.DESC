CC   This entry represents an N-terminal domain of approximately 135
CC   amino acids found in high molecular weight cytadherence protein 3
CC   (HMW3/Hlp3) from Mycoplasma species. The full-length protein binds
CC   fibronectin [1] and is a component of the cytoskeleton-like
CC   structure that stabilises the mycoplasma cell shape and anchors
CC   cytadhesin proteins at the attachment organelle. The protein
CC   localises to the attachment membrane. The function of this domain
CC   remains to be determined.
