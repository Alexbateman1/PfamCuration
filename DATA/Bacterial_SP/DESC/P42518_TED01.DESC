<<<<<<< HEAD
CC   This entry represents the N-terminal domain of cytochrome P450
CC   133B2 found in Xylella fastidiosa and related bacteria. Cytochrome
CC   P450 enzymes are a superfamily of haem-thiolate proteins involved in
CC   the oxidative degradation of various compounds. The function of this
CC   domain remains to be determined.
