TP   Domain
CC   This entry represents the N-terminal domain of the PrgT regulatory
CC   protein found in Enterococcus on the sex pheromone plasmid pAD1.
CC   The domain is approximately 51 amino acids in length. PrgT is
CC   involved in the expression of prgA, but is not required for
CC   activation of the expression of prgB. The specific function of
CC   this N-terminal domain remains to be determined.
